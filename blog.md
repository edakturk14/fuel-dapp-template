# Fuel Starter Kit â›½ðŸŒ´

*This post is co-authored by Eda and Carlos*

Modular blockchains offer a new approach by separating the fundamental components of blockchains into individual modules. By focusing on specific tasks, these modules allow for increased customization and improved efficiency. You can read an introduction to the modular architecture over [here](https://eda.hashnode.dev/modular-blockchains-getting-started-with-fuel).

Fuel is building the fastest Execution Layer for modular blockchains. Sway is the domain-specific programming language for Fuel and Fuel orchestrator (Forc) is the toolchain.

This blog post is an explianer for the Fuel dApp template. It's a new starter kit to hit the ground running when building decentralized applications on Fuel!

The starter kit is built using NextJS, DaisyUI, Forc, Sway and Typescript.

## Recap on Fuel

- Fuel has its own Virtual Machine called [FuelVM](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/what-is-fuel.html#fuelvm).
- Sway is a domain-specific language inspired by Rust to write smart contracts for the Fuel network.
- Fuel Orchestrator(Forc) is the system and package for Sway.

## Building on Fuel

Fuel is internally building and maintaing a full suite of developer tools:

- Sway Book ðŸŒ´
- Rust SDK Book
- TypeScript SDK

There's also the Fuel Forum to ask questions and follow updates.

## Starter Toolkit

- Feature 1
- Feature 2
- Feature 3
