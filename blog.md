# Fuel Starter Kit â›½ðŸŒ´

Modular blockchains offer a new approach by separating the fundamental components of blockchains into individual modules. By focusing on specific tasks, these modules allow for increased customization and improved efficiency. You can read an introduction to the modular architecture over [here](https://eda.hashnode.dev/modular-blockchains-getting-started-with-fuel).

Fuel is building the fastest Execution Layer for modular blockchains. Sway is the domain-specific programming language for Fuel and Fuel orchestrator (Forc) is the toolchain.

This blog post is an explianer for the Fuel dApp template. It's a new starter kit to hit the ground running when building decentralized applications on Fuel!

The starter kit is built using NextJS, DaisyUI, Forc, Sway and Typescript.
