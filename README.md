# Fuel Starter Kit â›½ðŸŒ´

The best way to get started building decentralized applications on Fuel! Built using NextJS, DaisyUI, Forc, Sway and Typescript.

- âœ… Smart contract in Sway
- ðŸ›  Easily setup your local toolchain or deploy to the Fuel Beta Testnet
- ðŸ‘› Fuel wallet connection

## QuickStart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.15.0 or newer
- [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Rust, Cargo and Forc (explained in the installation section)

### Installation

1. Install the Rust toolchain by following the steps [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/v0.24.3/introduction/installation.html#dependencies)

2. The **Fuel toolchain** is required to compile Sway contracts & run them on the FuelVM. Install the Fuel toolchain by the command below; you can also find the steps [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup)

    `$curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \ https://fuellabs.github.io/fuelup/fuelup-init.sh | sh`

3. The [beta-2 network](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/networks/beta-1.html) is the second public Fuel testnet. Install the beta-2 toolchain by using the following command:
    `fuelup toolchain install beta-2`

### Getting started

Clone this repo & install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/edakturk14/fuel-starter-kit.git
cd fuel-starter-kit
yarn install
```

### Local Deployments
1. Start the fuel chain locally
```
yarn fuel:chain
```

2. Deploy the example contract locally. Make sure to save the Contract ID.
```
yarn fuel:deploy:local
```

3. Update Contract ID (result from fuel:deploy:local) in `.env.development`.

4. Start your app and visit http://localhost:3000
```
yarn next:start
```

### Testnet deployments:

1. Generate a testnet wallet; you can follow the steps [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/developer-quickstart.html#deploy-the-contract)

2. Deploy the example contract
```
yarn fuel:deploy:testnet
```

The command will prompt you to sign the transaction. To get a signature open a another termainal and use the following command to generate a signature:

```
forc-wallet sign TRANSACTION_ID ACCOUNT_INDEX
```

Copy the signature from the previous terminal and paste it into your current terminal window and press enter to execute the signature.If everything goes as expected, the contract should be deployed successfully, and you should see the contract ID and block number displayed on the screen.

3. Update .env.development
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_SECRET (you can use the same account used for the deployment. Get the secret with `forc wallet export --account-index 0`)
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID (make sure to add 0x in the beginning of the contract id)

4. Start your app and visit http://localhost:3000
```
yarn next:start
```
