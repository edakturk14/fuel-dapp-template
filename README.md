# Fuel dApp Template â›½ðŸŒ´

The best way to get started building decentralized applications on Fuel! Built using NextJS, DaisyUI, Forc, Sway and Typescript.

- Out-of-the-box local toolchain & wallet setup
- Easily deploy your smart contract in Sway to your local toolchain or the Fuel Beta-2 testnet
- Customizable frontend built using Tailwind CSS

## QuickStart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.15.0 or newer
- [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Rust, Cargo and Forc (explained in the installation section)

### Installation

1. Install the Rust toolchain by following the steps [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/v0.24.3/introduction/installation.html#dependencies)

2. The **Fuel toolchain** is required to compile Sway contracts & run them on the FuelVM. Install the Fuel toolchain by the command below; you can also find the steps [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup)

```sh
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.fuel.network/fuelup-init.sh | sh
```

3. The [beta-2 network](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/networks/beta-1.html) is the second public Fuel testnet. Install the beta-2 toolchain by using the following command:
    `fuelup toolchain install beta-2`

### Getting started

Clone this repo & install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/edakturk14/fuel-starter-kit.git
cd fuel-starter-kit
yarn install
```

### Local Deployments
1. Start the fuel chain locally
```
yarn fuel:chain
```

2. Deploy the example contract locally. You'll see the contract ID on the terminal, make sure to save it.
```
yarn fuel:deploy:local
```

3. Update the Contract ID on `.env.development` in the nextjs folder.
```
# The target contract you want to interact with
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID=<YOUR_CONTRACT_ID>
```

4. Start your app & visit http://localhost:3000
```
yarn next:start
```

### Testnet deployments:

1. For a testnet deployment, you'll need a tesnet account. To generate a testnet wallet, follow the steps [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/developer-quickstart.html#deploy-the-contract)

2. Deploy the example contract to the Fuel Beta-2 testnet
```
yarn fuel:deploy:testnet
```

The command will prompt you to sign the transaction. To get a signature, open a another terminal and use the following command to generate a signature:

```
forc-wallet sign TRANSACTION_ID ACCOUNT_INDEX
```

Copy the signature from the previous terminal and paste it into your current terminal window. Then, press enter to execute the signature.

If everything goes well, the contract will be deployed to the testnet, and you'll see the contract ID and block number displayed on the terminal.

3. Update `.env.development` in the nextjs folder.
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_SECRET (you can use the same account used for the deployment. Get the secret with `forc wallet export --account-index 0`)
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID (you will need to add `0x` in the beginning of the contract-id)

4. Start your app & visit http://localhost:3000
```
yarn next:start
```
