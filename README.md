# Fuel Starter Kit â›½ðŸŒ´

The best way to get started building decentralized applications on Fuel! Built using NextJS, DaisyUI, Forc, Sway and Typescript.

- âœ… Smart contract in Sway
- ðŸ›  Easily setup your local toolchain or deploy to the Fuel Beta Testnet
- ðŸ‘› Fuel wallet connection

## QuickStart

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.15.0 or newer
- [Yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- Rust, Cargo and Forc (explained in the installation section)

### Installation

1. Install the Rust toolchain by following the steps [here](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/v0.24.3/introduction/installation.html#dependencies)

2. The **Fuel toolchain** is required to compile Sway contracts & run them on the FuelVM. Install the Fuel toolchain by the command below; you can also find the steps [here](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuelup)

    `$curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf \ https://fuellabs.github.io/fuelup/fuelup-init.sh | sh`

3. The [beta-2 network](https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/networks/beta-1.html) is the second public Fuel testnet. Install the beta-2 toolchain by using the following command:
    `fuelup toolchain install beta-2`

### Getting started

1. Clone this repo & install dependencies:
```
git clone https://github.com/edakturk14/fuel-starter-kit.git
cd fuel-starter-kit
yarn install
```

Writing here the current commands (we'll need to explain / format this better :D):

```bash
# Start the fuel chain locally
yarn fuel:chain
# Deploy the example contract locally (save the Contract ID!!)
yarn fuel:deploy:local
# Create the contract typings for the front-end app (maybe we can bundle this with yarn start)
yarn next:contract:typings
# Start the next app
yarn next:start
```

Update Contract ID (result from fuel:deploy:local) in `.env.development`. Wallet secret should be fine (using the one defined on fuel/chanConfig.json).

Visit http://localhost:3000.

**For testnet deployments**:
- Generate a testnet wallet first (https://fuellabs.github.io/fuel-docs/master/developer-quickstart.html#deploy-the-contract)
- Run `yarn fuel:deploy:testnet`.
- It will prompt you to sign the tx. You can do it with:

```bash
# Account index 
forc wallet sign --id MESSAGE_TO_SIGN --account-index 0
# In the docs they say to use forc wallet sign` + `[message to sign, without brackets]` + `[the account number, without brackets]`
# but it seems it was for an older version
```

- Update .env.development
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=testnet
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLET_SECRET (you can use the same account used for the deployment. Get the secret with `forc wallet export --account-index 0`)
  - NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ID (displayed after deploying the contract)

- `yarn next:contract:typings`
- `yarn next:start`

- Visit http://localhost:3000.
